The new Supercell encryption is still sodium based, however, something has changed. 
The encryption logic is quite different, but what's more challenging in all of this - is surely revengineering the crypto core.

Say bye bye to hsalsa/salsa core from sodium.
The new core has been manually written by Supercell and obfuscated as hell with Arxan.

The code is WIP and suck hard, i'll need to clean the loops later once i finish it... the hardest part is done and the logic looks quite clear at me.
I'm still translating line by line the ARM assembly code.

### Hey leachers!

this will gives you nothing and won't be enough to replicate a client. But feel free to get inside the secRet crew slack to have a chance to get all the needed stuffs. <3
